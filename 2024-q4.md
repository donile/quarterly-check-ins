# Employee Comments

## Accomplishments

_Whatâ€™s working Well. List top accomplishments from the past quarter. Think beyond projects - mention impact your accomplishments have made and how you achieved them. Here are some of the areas to structure your thoughts - Technical Expertise, Design, Execution, Collaboration, Quality, Scope_

[Leveling Criteria](https://paylocity1.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ProductandTech/EbTHXtTmEflGvPCXd4BvRp0BpWPlWykrHsi233hMe5tmyw?e=qP5kiL)

### Optimizes beyond just the team by driving cross-team initiatives
(Level: Staff Software Engineer)

#### Situation

Teams, such as Onboarding, wanted notifications when Custom Fields' resources changed so they can update their feature's resources accordingly.

#### Task

[Publish Custom Fields' messages to the Enterprise Messaging Platform](https://paylocity.atlassian.net/browse/EMP-2152).

#### Action

Collaborated (in a private Slack [thread](https://paylocity.slack.com/archives/C085ZC00AV6/p1736431538792039)) with engineers (Charles Graham, Kevin Warnke and Jan Jezek) across multiple teams and designed a [Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html) implementation for APIs that use MongoDB for persistance.

[Implemented the pattern](https://github.com/Paylocity/paylocity.corehr.customfields.workengine/blob/feature/emp-2152-no-generics/docs/enterprise-messaging-platform-message-publication.md) for Custom Fields API.

Created an [epic](https://paylocity.atlassian.net/browse/EMP-2361) to document the work necessary to extra the Custom Fields implementation to a NuGet package that other teams can add to work engine projects and easily add multiple outboxes consumers for multiple MongoDBs.

#### Result

Messages are published to the Enterprise Messaging Platform

The [dual-write problem](https://www.confluent.io/blog/dual-write-problem/) was avoided

Avoided using MongoDB transactions ([as recommended](https://paylocity.slack.com/archives/C016PBHK30A/p1684266657500399?thread_ts=1684186788.091149&cid=C016PBHK30A))

`Paylocity.WorkEngine.Outbox.Mongo` NuGet package will be available to consumers in the near future


### Plays a key role in mediating team level technical disagreements driving toward a unified decision forward

(Level: Staff Software Engineer)

#### Situation

Users wanted to upload person-level data.  Originally, product asked for company users from company A to be permitted to upload data for an employee in company B.  The engineering team disagreed with the requirement provided by product because it would allow a user from company A to view and modify data associated with an individual that does not work for company A

**Example**

A user in company A uploads a CSV file that contains a new social security number for an employee in company B.

#### Task

[Design a solution](https://paylocity.atlassian.net/browse/EMP-2303) to allow users to upload person-level data.

#### Action

[Designed a solution](https://paylocity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EMP/pages/1253572609/EMP-2317+Person+Level+Bulk+Upload) that met nearly all of Product's requirements and [prevented users](https://paylocity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EMP/pages/1253572609/EMP-2317+Person+Level+Bulk+Upload#Personas) from company A from accessing and/or modifying person-level data for employees outside of company A.  After designing the solution, I met with the engineering manager [Rachel Grebner] and the product owner [Darlene Daniels].  During the meeting an incomplete version of the security diagram was initially shown and then we completed the diagram together, eventually agreeing that users from company A should not be able to access or modify information associated with employees that are not associated with company A.

#### Result

When the Person-Level Bulk Upload epic is completed, users from company A will not be able to access or modify person-level data for employees outside of company A.

## Reflection

_What could be improved. Reflect how the quarter went in relation to your accomplishments, development goals and career growth actions. What progress are you making toward your priorities and professional development?_

The quarter was relatively successful.

Teams interested in consuming messages about Custom Fields' resources will be able to consume events from the enterprise messaging platform in the near future.  Using the outbox pattern to avoid the dual-write problem and creating a configurable library that will allow the outbox pattern to be quickly setup will help the emerging platforms team and Paylocity.

Our team's API design is moving in a positive direction.  We are adopting more API-First standards, which will allow us to move faster in the long-run and it will make it easier for consumers to use our API, increasing adoption.  I think it would benefit the team if I were more involved in backend designs earlier in the design process.  I would be happy to mentor and colloborate the team's engineers as they start backend designs.


## Goals
